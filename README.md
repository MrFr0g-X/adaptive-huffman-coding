## üìù Introduction

Adaptive Huffman coding is a variant of Huffman coding that builds the encoding tree dynamically as data is processed, allowing for single-pass compression without requiring a preliminary analysis of the entire dataset. This implementation follows the FGK (Faller-Gallager-Knuth) algorithm, which maintains a binary tree that satisfies the "sibling property" - ensuring optimal compression as each symbol is processed.

Unlike standard Huffman coding that requires two passes (one to compute frequencies, one to encode), the adaptive approach updates the tree on-the-fly. This makes it suitable for streaming applications, memory-constrained environments, and scenarios where the entire dataset is not available upfront.

## üîç Algorithm Overview

### Theory

Adaptive Huffman coding is based on several key principles:

#### 1. NYT (Not Yet Transmitted) Node
- Each time a new symbol is encountered, it's encoded using the NYT node
- The NYT node always represents symbols not yet seen in the input
- The NYT node is initially the only node in the tree

#### 2. Sibling Property
- Nodes can be ordered by increasing weight when traversed from left to right, bottom to top
- Nodes with the same weight should be ordered by their creation time (older nodes have higher order)
- This property ensures the tree maintains optimal compression at each step

#### 3. Dynamic Tree Updates
- Each time a symbol appears, its weight is incremented
- Node swapping may occur to maintain the sibling property
- The tree structure evolves as symbols are processed

### Encoding Process

1. Start with a tree containing only the NYT node
2. For each character in the input:
     - If already seen, output its current code and update its weight
     - If new, output NYT code followed by the character's ASCII representation
3. After each character, update the tree to maintain the sibling property

### Decoding Process

1. Start with the same initial tree as the encoder
2. Follow the encoded bits down the tree until reaching a leaf node
3. If the leaf is NYT, read the next 8 bits as an ASCII character
4. If the leaf is a symbol node, output that symbol
5. Update the tree exactly as the encoder did
6. Continue until all bits are processed

**Important Note:** While the algorithm description suggests using the "same tree," proper implementation requires separate tree instances for encoding and decoding that evolve independently but identically through the same input sequence. This ensures proper adaptive behavior on both ends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Node.java
Represents a node in the Huffman tree with:
- Character data (symbol)
- Weight (frequency count)
- Parent and child references
- Order number (for sibling property)
- Type identification methods (isLeaf(), isNYT())

```java
public class Node {
        char symbol;                    // Character this node represents
        int weight;                     // Frequency counter
        Node left, right, parent;       // Tree connections
        int order;                      // Node order (for sibling property)
        
        // Methods to check node type
        public boolean isLeaf() { return (left == null && right == null); }
        public boolean isNYT() { return isLeaf() && weight == 0; }
}
```

#### HuffmanTree.java
The central class that:
- Manages the adaptive tree structure
- Handles insertion of new symbols
- Updates weights and maintains sibling property through node swapping
- Provides path lookup for encoding/decoding

Key methods:
```java
public void insertNewSymbol(char c) {
        // Adds a new character to the tree:
        // 1. Create internal node to replace current NYT
        // 2. Create new NYT node and character node as children
        // 3. Update tree structure and weights
}

void updateTree(Node node) {
        // Updates weights from node to root
        // Maintains sibling property through swapping
}

void swapIfNeeded(Node node) {
        // Finds and swaps with highest-order node of same weight if needed
        // Critical for maintaining the sibling property
}

String getPath(Node node) {
        // Returns binary path from root to node (0=left, 1=right)
        // Uses caching for performance
}
```

#### Encoder.java
Handles the encoding process:
- Takes input text and produces binary representation
- Manages the encoding logic (existing vs. new symbols)
- Updates the tree after each symbol

```java
public String encode(String text) {
        StringBuilder encoded = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
                if (tree.contains(c)) {
                        // Existing character: output its current code, update frequency
                        encoded.append(tree.getCode(c));
                        tree.updateExistingSymbol(c);
                } else {
                        // New character: output NYT code + ASCII, add to tree
                        encoded.append(tree.getNYTCode());
                        encoded.append(toAscii(c));
                        tree.insertNewSymbol(c);
                }
        }
        return encoded.toString();
}
```

#### Decoder.java
Handles the decoding process:
- Takes binary input and produces original text
- Traverses the tree bit-by-bit
- Updates the tree identically to the encoder

```java
public String decode(String bits) {
        StringBuilder decoded = new StringBuilder();
        Node current = tree.root;
        int i = 0;

        while (i <= bits.length()) {
                if (current.isLeaf()) {
                        if (current == tree.NYT) {
                                // NYT node: read ASCII bits for new character
                                String asciiBits = bits.substring(i, i + 8);
                                char c = (char)Integer.parseInt(asciiBits, 2);
                                decoded.append(c);
                                tree.insertNewSymbol(c);
                                i += 8;
                        } else {
                                // Character node: output its symbol
                                decoded.append(current.symbol);
                                tree.updateExistingSymbol(current.symbol);
                        }
                        current = tree.root;  // Reset to root for next character
                } else {
                        // Navigate based on current bit
                        if (bits.charAt(i) == '0') current = current.left;
                        else current = current.right;
                        i++;
                }
        }
        return decoded.toString();
}
```

## üìä Test Cases & Performance

### Test Case Results

#### Test Case 1: Repetitive Content

```
Original text: AAAAAAAA
Original size (bits): 64
Encoded bits: 010000011111111
Encoded size (bits): 15
Compression ratio: 76.56%
Decoded text: AAAAAAAA
Verification: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

Analysis: Excellent compression (76.56%) with repetitive content. The first 'A' requires 9 bits (NYT + ASCII), but subsequent 'A's need only 1 bit each.

#### Test Case 2: Mixed Content with Repeats

```
Original text: ABABABC
Original size (bits): 56
Encoded bits: 010000010010000101010110001000011
Encoded size (bits): 33
Compression ratio: 41.07%
Decoded text: ABABABC
Verification: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

Analysis: Good compression (41.07%) with alternating pattern. New characters require full encoding, but repeats benefit from shorter codes.

#### Test Case 3: No Repetition

```
Original text: ABCDEFGH
Original size (bits): 64
Encoded bits: 01000001001000010000100001100001000100000001000101000000100011000000001000111000000001001000
Encoded size (bits): 92
Compression ratio: -43.75%
Decoded text: ABCDEFGH
Verification: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

Analysis: Negative compression (-43.75%) with unique characters. Each new symbol requires NYT + ASCII encoding, resulting in expansion.

#### Test Case 4: MISSISSIPPI

```
Original text: MISSISSIPPI
Original size (bits): 88
Encoded bits: 010011010010010010001010011001010010010100001010000000101
Encoded size (bits): 57
Compression ratio: 35.23%
Decoded text: MISSISSIPPI
Verification: SUCCESS ‚úì
```

Analysis: Good compression (35.23%) with repeated patterns.

#### Test Case 5: Special Characters

```
Input: ‚Ç¨¬•‚Çπ‚ô†‚ô£‚òÖ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí
Original size (bits): 80
Encoded size (bits): 160
Match?: true
```

Analysis: For special Unicode characters, a direct 16-bit encoding approach is used rather than adaptive Huffman. This ensures compatibility with characters outside the ASCII range at the cost of compression efficiency.

### Performance Analysis

- **Best Case** üöÄ: Highly repetitive content (~70-80% compression)
- **Average Case** ‚ö°: Mixed content with repeats (~30-60% compression)
- **Worst Case** ‚ö†Ô∏è: No repetition (slight expansion due to overhead)
- **Special Cases**: Unicode characters use direct 16-bit encoding

## üîß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Tree Swapping Complexities

**Problem:** The node swapping mechanism to maintain the sibling property was complex and prone to errors, including infinite loops and tree corruption.

**Solution:**
- Implemented careful reference management during swaps
- Added pre-swap validation with cycle detection
- Created a tree integrity checker to detect issues
- Added auto-recovery mechanism to rebuild corrupted trees

### Challenge 2: Performance with Complex Inputs

**Problem:** Large or complex inputs could cause performance bottlenecks or stack overflows due to deep recursion.

**Solution:**
- Added path caching to avoid recalculating tree paths
- Implemented simplified mode that limits expensive operations
- Replaced recursive operations with iterative versions for critical paths
- Added configurable depth limits for recursive operations

### Challenge 3: Debugging Tree State

**Problem:** Difficult to visualize and understand tree evolution, especially during node swapping.

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive visualization component
- Added real-time tree rendering with node details
- Implemented step-by-step encoding/decoding visualization
- Added debug output for sibling property validation

### Challenge 4: Separate Trees for Encoding/Decoding

**Problem:** Initially the same tree instance was shared between encoder and decoder, causing incorrect decoding because the tree state was already modified by encoding.

**Solution:**
- Implemented separate tree instances for encoding and decoding
- Ensured both trees evolve through identical steps independently
- Added test cases to verify correct encoder-decoder separation
- Validated with various input types including special characters
